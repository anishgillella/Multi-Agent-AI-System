            "Nvidia shares rebounded Tuesday, halting a three-day skid that had surprised many investors and wiped away more than $400 billion in market value. Early last week, Nvidia overtook Microsoft as Wall Street’s most valuable public company. Then it fell 13% over three days, its worst such stretch since 2022. Because Nvidia has become so massive in size, the movements for its stock carry extra weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.Any stock that climbs as much as Nvidia has — up more than 1,000% since the autumn of 2022 — is vulnerable to some of its investors selling shares in order to lock in some profits. That earlier run makes a 13% drop over three days look like a relative trifle.Monday, Nvidia shares rose 6.8%, bringing its market value to $3.10 trillion, behind Microsoft at $3.35 trillion and Apple at $3.21 trillion.Those three companies and a few others are responsible for much of the S&P 500’s returns recently. Investors would prefer a market where many stocks are participating in the gains. \n",
            "There’s been nearly insatiable demand for Nvidia’s chips to power artificial intelligence applications and the company has played a big role in the U.S. stock market’s recent record runs even as the economy’s growth slows under the weight of high interest rates. But the AI boom is moving at such a rapid pace that it’s raised worries about a possible bubble in the stock market and too-high expectations among investors. RELATED COVERAGE\n",

            "Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a statement that while Nvidia’s stock has declined in recent days, one must also look at the bigger picture.\n",
            "“The shares have still gained 190% on a 12-month view, so it’s no surprise some investors are locking in some profits,” he said.Nathan also isn’t concerned about potential wider spread implications. “Although Nvidia has sneezed, the wider market hasn’t caught a cold with a mixture of less extreme movements in both directions for the rest of the Magnificent 7,” he said.\n",
            "The Magnificent 7, which include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, are a small group of stocks that are responsible for a big chunk of the U.S. stock market’s total return. Some critics say Nvidia still looks expensive. Its stock is trading at a price that’s 73 times higher than the profit that it’s produced over the last 12 months. That makes it look much more expensive than the broad S&P 500 index, where companies are trading at just 26 times their overall earnings. That itself looks pricey to skeptics, who say the broad U.S. stock market looks expensive compared with history.The thing Nvidia has going for it is the possibility of continued, incredible growth as it ushers in a new era that proponents say will remake the economy.Based on its expected profit over the next 12 months, Nvidia is trading at a still expensive but more reasonable price-earnings ratio of roughly 40. And if generative AI hardware deployments are still only in year two of what could be a three-to-five year deployment cycle, as analysts at Bank of America suggest, the possible runway of growth could make it look even more compelling.\n",
            "Analysts estimate that the company’s revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January 2025 will reach $119.9 billion — about double its revenue for fiscal 2024 and more than four times its receipts the year before that.__Associated Press Business Writer Stan Choe in New York contributed to this report. \n",

            "Based on the articles from Yahoo Finance and Investor's Business Daily, the recent market trends for NVDA (Nvidia) stock show a mixed outlook. The artificial intelligence boom is significantly influencing the stock, with Nvidia being a major player in this market. However, after a recent fall from its peak, Wall Street analysts are debating the future direction of the stock. Some believe that Nvidia is overpriced compared to the broader market, despite its rapid growth in revenue and earnings. Others argue that the stock's price is justified given Nvidia's strategic focus on data centers and AI technology. The AI boom has led to a strong performance for Nvidia's stock, with the S&P 500 climbing 15% this year, largely due to Nvidia's ascent. However, recent concerns about the company's valuation and a decline in its stock price have raised questions about whether it can maintain its top spot.

            "03:12 PM ET 06/20/2024\n",
            "Nvidia (NVDA) stock reversed lower Thursday as other chip stocks with artificial intelligence exposure also fell. For investors, the question is whether Nvidia stock is a buy now.\n",

            "AMD Executive Touts These AI Chip Advantages As Battle With Nvidia Heats Up\n",
            "On Tuesday, analysts at Barclays, Susquehanna and TD Cowen increased their price targets on the stock. With investors still loving Nvidia, the stock climbed to a record high Thursday before pulling back.\n",
            "Barclay's analyst Tom O'Malley and Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland raised the price target to 145 from 120, split adjusted. Supply chain checks were reassuring and showed that the transition from Hopper chips to Blackwell will be smooth.\n",
            "Demand Rising For AI Chips In Servers\n",
            "Earlier this month, Nvidia said it plans to roll out its most advanced artificial intelligence platform in 2026. The AI chip leader will also use next generation memory to improve process time.\n",
            "Also in early June, Foxconn announced its plans to build an advanced computing center in Taiwan using Nvidia's Blackwell chips. Nvidia has teamed up with Foxconn to build data centers to expand into autonomous driving and the electric vehicles market. While leading electric-vehicle player Tesla (TSLA) uses Nvidia's chips, it plans to custom build them in-house in the future.\n",
            "Nvidia Stock Split Takes Effect\n",
            "Shares started trading on a split-adjusted basis on June 1o.\n",
            "But the split could go beyond just lowering the price of each share. A lower price would make Nvidia a candidate for the Dow 30, which is a price-weighted index.\n",
            "Previously, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) joined the Dow after stock splits.\n",
            "The stock split will build further momentum for the AI chip leader and present what one analyst called a \"generational buying opportunity.\"\n",
            "In late May, Nvidia shares soared above the pre-split 1,100 level for the first time after Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk indicated the AI chip leader would be a supplier for his AI startup xAI. Musk's startup raised $6 billion in the latest round of funding over the weekend and it plans to build a supercomputer to support its AI chatbot.\n",
            "First-Quarter Results Shine\n",
            "Shares of Nvidia rose to record highs after fiscal first-quarter results beat estimates yet again on May 22. Sales grew 262% to $26 billion while earnings of $6.12 per share were 461% higher.\n",
            "The AI leader has also teamed up with Microsoft to make the latest AI software available on Nvidia's graphic processing units.\n",
            "Earlier, Nvidia shares rose past a handle buy point after the Google AI Conference showed different ways in which artificial intelligence will improve search. The search giant also previewed an Android feature that will alert users to scams during a phone call. While Google's tensor processing units are rivals to Nvidia's chips, Nvidia dominates the data center AI chips market.\n",
            "Ahead of the earnings report, analysts at Baird, Susquehanna and Barclays increased their price targets on Nvidia.\n",
            "Nvidia stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B- on an A+ to E scale.\n",
            "AI Products Drive Growth\n",
            "Nvidia has earned a reputation for being a trailblazer. The company was an early pioneer in the graphics processors that many say drastically improved computer gaming. Along with gaming, Nvidia chips now are used in such industries as health care, automobiles and robotics.\n",
            "In March 2023, generative AI took a leap forward with OpenAI's ChatGPT. According to Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang, Nvidia's AI-capable supercomputer paved the way for the \"iPhone moment of AI.\"\n",
            "That helped Nvidia turn the tide on its results. It reported three quarters of declining year-over-year sales and four quarters of tapering earnings in late 2022 and early 2023. But then the company achieved record top- and bottom-line growth in the two most recent quarters.\n",
            "Overall worldwide AI chip revenue will grow 26% from $53.4 billion in 2023 to $67.1 billion in 2024, according to a recent report from research firm Gartner. That is expected to double to $119 billion by 2027.\n",

            "Top Ratings For Nvidia\n",
            "Nvidia stock still boasts a best-possible score of 99 on its Composite Rating, EPS Rating and Relative Strength Rating.\n",
            "Nvidia also is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks that led the 2023 stock rally. The other stocks are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla and Amazon.com. Some of these tech titans are customers that rely on Nvidia's advanced chips. Nvidia is also one of the stocks that are forecast to outperform the market in 2024.\n",
            "Is Nvidia A Buy?\n",
            "Chart patterns are a good way of telling when to buy or sell a stock. Nvidia's chart shows the stock has cleared a 92.22 buy point. The stock is already extended, according to IBD MarketSurge.\n",
            "In 2023, AI stock Nvidia had a huge 239% run and it's up more than 190% so far this year.\n",
            "Nvidia has climbed above profit-taking targets at 20% and 25% from 92.20 and an alternative buy point at  97.40. It's best now to wait for another base or follow-on buy point to make an initial position in the AI chip stock. It is not a buy right now.\n",

It mentions that Nvidia has plans to roll out its most advanced artificial intelligence platform in 2026 and is teaming up with Foxconn to expand into autonomous driving and the electric vehicles market. It also shares that the overall worldwide AI chip revenue is expected to grow 26% from $53.4 billion in 2023 to $67.1 billion in 2024, and double to $119 billion by 2027. The article suggests that Nvidia's graphic processing units help accelerate computing in data centers and AI applications, and the company has high ratings in terms of composite, EPS, and relative strength. However, the article advises waiting for another base or follow-on buy point to make an initial position in the AI chip stock. This information is valuable in shaping the trading strategy for NVDA.

Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the backtested returns presented. Certain assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable. Please note all regulatory considerations regarding the presentation of fees must be taken into account. No cash balance or cash flow is included in the calculation.\n",

Our TP is derived on 28.5x blended 2-year forward P/BV, pegged to +2.4 SD above its 5-year average. We see Nvidia’s rich valuations justiﬁed as it continues to beneﬁt from the surging/growing AI demand – consensus currently ascribes an above-peers, 2024-28 CAGR revenue growth of 42.3% for the data center segment. Technological strides in AI-chips (through H200 GPU, Blackwell chips, Blackwell Ultra in 2025, Rubin in 2026) only further cement Nvidia’s leadership position in the AI-chips space and is clearly evident in its exemplary ﬁnancial performance. A lacklustre result and/or forward guidance that suggests slowdown in AI momentum is a key risk to watch.Rick Schafer Oppenheimer$150Buy20.98%UpsideAssigned06/11/2400Buckle Up for Another Surge, Says Oppenheimer About Nvidia Stock - TipRanks.comAccording to Oppenheimers Rick Schafer, a 5-star analyst ranked in 4th spot amongst the thousands of Wall Street stock pros, theres still more room to run from here. Schafer has adjusted his price target on NVDA following the split, raising it from $110 to a joint Street-high of $150. This adjustment implies a further 16% potential increase from current levels. It hardly needs mentioning, but Schafers rating remains an Outperform (i.e., Buy).

Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the backtested returns presented. Certain assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable. Please note all regulatory considerations regarding the presentation of fees must be taken into account. No cash balance or cash flow is included in the calculation.\n",

            "Nvidia's market value surpasses $1 trillion in 2023, fueled by the generative AI boom, rebounding tech sector and 239% stock growth in 2023. However, there may be challenges ahead.\n",

            "By\n",
            "Amanda Hetler,\n",
            "Senior Editor\n",
            "Published: 20 Jun 2024\n",
            "Nvidia continues to grow as it surpassed the $3.335 trillion mark on June 18, 2024, and has now passed Microsoft to become the largest-listed U.S. company based on market value. A few weeks prior, Nvidia passed Apple to become the second most valuable company. In the middle of 2023, Nvidia passed the $1 trillion mark and was more valuable than Amazon and Alphabet, Google's parent company. In just nine months, the company's market worth increased from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in February 2024, and it took only three months to reach $3 trillion in June 2024.\n",
            "The rise of Nvidia took some time. The tech sector faced a rough 2022. It started to rebound in 2023 despite tech layoffs. Generative AI is one of the main drivers of its rebound, and the stock market is showing signs of this rebound. The Nasdaq index is heavy in tech stocks and finished 2023 up 43%. The rise of generative AI led to a tech bull market, which is a time of expansion in the stock exchange.\n",
            "The top-tier group of tech stocks is known as the Magnificent Seven and includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. The Magnificent Seven company stocks were up an average of 111% in 2023, and Nvidia was up 239% in 2023.\n",
            "On June 7, 2024, Nvidia stock completed a 10-for-1 stock split, which will make its stock price approximately $120 from $1,200. The shares will begin trading at the split-adjusted rates on June 10, 2024. Nvidia is splitting its stock to make it more accessible to employees and investors. This split will not change the overall value of the company. This means any stockholder who owned a share of stock before the split will receive nine more shares after the split. Over time, this lower stock price makes it easier for investors to access shares.\n",
            "Even with the daily ups and downs of the stock market, investors are taking notice of this growth and wondering how much the AI demand may drive the tech market in 2024.\n",
            "The rise of Nvidia\n",
            "Nvidia is one of the world's largest producers of GPUs. GPUs are computer chips or semiconductors that use math operations to produce visuals and images. The GPU manages and speeds up graphic workloads and displays visual content on a device such as PC or smartphone.\n",
            "Each of Nvidia's earnings reports exceeded expectations throughout 2023 as AI started gaining momentum and attention. Nvidia's advanced chips can use and process the massive amounts needed to train generative AI programs, such as ChatGPT and Gemini. Since Nvidia dominated this market before the increasing need for AI, Nvidia only grew larger as demand soared.\n",
            "Nvidia reported revenue of $26.0 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter ending April 28, 2024. This revenue was up 18% from the third quarter and up 262% from one year prior. The company earned record quarterly data center revenue of $22.6 billion, which increased 23% from the fourth quarter and was up a noticeable 427% from the previous year.\n",
            "To put it in perspective, companies -- such as Apple and Microsoft -- are spending money on AI, and Nvidia is making money on AI as it produces the chips to run the technology.\n",
            "Nvidia reported revenue of $22.1 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter ending Jan. 28, 2024. This revenue was up 22% from the third quarter and up 265% from one year prior. The company earned $60.9 billion for its full-year revenue, which was up 126%.\n",
            "Businesses need hardware to support high amounts of energy with the AI wave, but these advanced chips are also needed for the metaverse, gaming and spatial computing. Nvidia also makes chips for cars as technology continues to advance.\n",
            "The core reasons for the rise of Nvidia stock\n",
            "The rise of generative AI is one of the key factors of Nvidia's rise. However, there are some other reasons Nvidia stock increased significantly.\n",
            "1. The rise of supercomputers\n",
            "Nvidia's chips power supercomputers because of the large amounts of data needed for this advanced technology. Supercomputing technology is used by companies, such as Meta for its AI Research SuperCluster computer, to train complex AI models. Tesla is also starting to build an AI-focused supercomputer for its vehicles.\n",
            "2. Demand for generative AI\n",
            "With no signs of the demand for generative AI slowing down, Nvidia is poised to grow as each new system is adopted. The AI industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42% in the next 10 years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The demand for generative AI products could make the generative AI market worth $1.3 trillion by 2032.\n",
            "Nvidia's A100 GPU chips are used in training the model for ChatGPT. Companies, such as OpenAI, that use large amounts of data for tasks such as training large language models evolve quickly and need more accelerated computing. The demand for GPUs will only grow as these systems train and evolve with more data.\n",
            "3. The changing world of the metaverse and XR\n",
            "Nvidia has played a role in the metaverse and the virtual and augmented reality landscape with its Omniverse platform. Nvidia offers 3D modeling programs to help stream extended reality (XR) content efficiently. As the metaverse evolves, so does the demand for Nvidia chips to run the metaverse. Companies are turning to XR programs to create virtual environments for training.\n",
            "The gaming world is also a large customer of Nvidia's graphics division. Video games need stronger cards to run the high-resolution images, especially as more games move to the cloud and away from the console. Nvidia's gaming GPUs, such as GeForce RTX 4070, help power video games at a higher resolution and quicker speed.\n",
            "4. Strategic placement\n",
            "Nvidia is a large part of the cryptocurrency world. Miners use its cards for mining tokens, which requires a great deal of power. There was an unprecedented demand for Nvidia's cards as cryptocurrency took off.\n",
            "Future of Nvidia\n",
            "While Nvidia's processors run most of the data centers that power generative AI, there are still some possible challenges ahead, including competition from tech giants to make their own AI chips, economic uncertainty and a rise in competition.\n",
            "The generative AI market is expected to continue growing, but more rules and regulations are going to be introduced that could affect Nvidia's AI chips. The U.S. trade restrictions on China's advanced semiconductors are also impacting Nvidia's growth, as Chinese sales were a large part of Nvidia's data center sales.\n",
            "With Nvidia's noticeable growth, other competitors are offering similar chips, such as AMD's Instinct MI200 family of GPU accelerators. Intel also launched a set of fifth-generation Intel Xeon processors for data centers. Companies may not want to rely on one company and will start exploring these other vendors, which could hurt Nvidia's growth.\n",
            "It's hard to predict whether Nvidia will continue its growth at its current pace. Nvidia has built a solid foundation in the AI market, and if the generative AI market grows as predicted, its revenue will continue to grow. But it's unknown how much of the market Nvidia's competitors will take. Nvidia still has a strong share in the face of rising competition as it recently announced its H200 computing platform. Cloud providers such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft have developed AI processors, but they work with Nvidia chips.\n",
            "The market is evolving quickly. Enterprises are looking to adopt generative AI, leading to the creation of new vendors to meet business needs. New areas such as security and compliance will also change the generative AI market in the business world.\n",

Our TP is derived on 28.5x blended 2-year forward P/BV, pegged to +2.4 SD above its 5-year average. We see Nvidia’s rich valuations justiﬁed as it continues to beneﬁt from the surging/growing AI demand – consensus currently ascribes an above-peers, 2024-28 CAGR revenue growth of 42.3% for the data center segment. Technological strides in AI-chips (through H200 GPU, Blackwell chips, Blackwell Ultra in 2025, Rubin in 2026) only further cement Nvidia’s leadership position in the AI-chips space and is clearly evident in its exemplary ﬁnancial performance. A lacklustre result and/or forward guidance that suggests slowdown in AI momentum is a key risk to watch.Rick Schafer Oppenheimer$150Buy20.98%UpsideAssigned06/11/2400Buckle Up for Another Surge, Says Oppenheimer About Nvidia Stock - TipRanks.comAccording to Oppenheimers Rick Schafer, a 5-star analyst ranked in 4th spot amongst the thousands of Wall Street stock pros, theres still more room to run from here. Schafer has adjusted his price target on NVDA following the split, raising it from $110 to a joint Street-high of $150. This adjustment implies a further 16% potential increase from current levels. It hardly needs mentioning, but Schafers rating remains an Outperform (i.e., Buy).

Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the backtested returns presented. Certain assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable. Please note all regulatory considerations regarding the presentation of fees must be taken into account. No cash balance or cash flow is included in the calculation.\n",

            "Nvidia (NVDA) stock reversed lower Thursday as other chip stocks with artificial intelligence exposure also fell. For investors, the question is whether Nvidia stock is a buy now.\n",

            "AMD Executive Touts These AI Chip Advantages As Battle With Nvidia Heats Up\n",
            "On Tuesday, analysts at Barclays, Susquehanna and TD Cowen increased their price targets on the stock. With investors still loving Nvidia, the stock climbed to a record high Thursday before pulling back.\n",
            "Barclay's analyst Tom O'Malley and Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland raised the price target to 145 from 120, split adjusted. Supply chain checks were reassuring and showed that the transition from Hopper chips to Blackwell will be smooth.\n",
            "Demand Rising For AI Chips In Servers\n",
            "Earlier this month, Nvidia said it plans to roll out its most advanced artificial intelligence platform in 2026. The AI chip leader will also use next generation memory to improve process time.\n",
            "Also in early June, Foxconn announced its plans to build an advanced computing center in Taiwan using Nvidia's Blackwell chips. Nvidia has teamed up with Foxconn to build data centers to expand into autonomous driving and the electric vehicles market. While leading electric-vehicle player Tesla (TSLA) uses Nvidia's chips, it plans to custom build them in-house in the future.\n",
            "Nvidia Stock Split Takes Effect\n",
            "Shares started trading on a split-adjusted basis on June 1o.\n",
            "But the split could go beyond just lowering the price of each share. A lower price would make Nvidia a candidate for the Dow 30, which is a price-weighted index.\n",
            "Previously, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) joined the Dow after stock splits.\n",
            "The stock split will build further momentum for the AI chip leader and present what one analyst called a \"generational buying opportunity.\"\n",
            "In late May, Nvidia shares soared above the pre-split 1,100 level for the first time after Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk indicated the AI chip leader would be a supplier for his AI startup xAI. Musk's startup raised $6 billion in the latest round of funding over the weekend and it plans to build a supercomputer to support its AI chatbot.\n",
            "First-Quarter Results Shine\n",
            "Shares of Nvidia rose to record highs after fiscal first-quarter results beat estimates yet again on May 22. Sales grew 262% to $26 billion while earnings of $6.12 per share were 461% higher.\n",
            "The AI leader has also teamed up with Microsoft to make the latest AI software available on Nvidia's graphic processing units.\n",
            "Earlier, Nvidia shares rose past a handle buy point after the Google AI Conference showed different ways in which artificial intelligence will improve search. The search giant also previewed an Android feature that will alert users to scams during a phone call. While Google's tensor processing units are rivals to Nvidia's chips, Nvidia dominates the data center AI chips market.\n",
            "Ahead of the earnings report, analysts at Baird, Susquehanna and Barclays increased their price targets on Nvidia.\n",
            "Nvidia stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B- on an A+ to E scale.\n",
            "AI Products Drive Growth\n",
            "Nvidia has earned a reputation for being a trailblazer. The company was an early pioneer in the graphics processors that many say drastically improved computer gaming. Along with gaming, Nvidia chips now are used in such industries as health care, automobiles and robotics.\n",
            "In March 2023, generative AI took a leap forward with OpenAI's ChatGPT. According to Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang, Nvidia's AI-capable supercomputer paved the way for the \"iPhone moment of AI.\"\n",
            "That helped Nvidia turn the tide on its results. It reported three quarters of declining year-over-year sales and four quarters of tapering earnings in late 2022 and early 2023. But then the company achieved record top- and bottom-line growth in the two most recent quarters.\n",
            "Overall worldwide AI chip revenue will grow 26% from $53.4 billion in 2023 to $67.1 billion in 2024, according to a recent report from research firm Gartner. That is expected to double to $119 billion by 2027.\n",

            "Top Ratings For Nvidia\n",
            "Nvidia stock still boasts a best-possible score of 99 on its Composite Rating, EPS Rating and Relative Strength Rating.\n",
            "Nvidia also is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks that led the 2023 stock rally. The other stocks are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla and Amazon.com. Some of these tech titans are customers that rely on Nvidia's advanced chips. Nvidia is also one of the stocks that are forecast to outperform the market in 2024.\n",
            "Is Nvidia A Buy?\n",
            "Chart patterns are a good way of telling when to buy or sell a stock. Nvidia's chart shows the stock has cleared a 92.22 buy point. The stock is already extended, according to IBD MarketSurge.\n",
            "In 2023, AI stock Nvidia had a huge 239% run and it's up more than 190% so far this year.\n",
            "Nvidia has climbed above profit-taking targets at 20% and 25% from 92.20 and an alternative buy point at  97.40. It's best now to wait for another base or follow-on buy point to make an initial position in the AI chip stock. It is not a buy right now.\n",

            "Nvidia's market value surpasses $1 trillion in 2023, fueled by the generative AI boom, rebounding tech sector and 239% stock growth in 2023. However, there may be challenges ahead.\n",
            "Share this item with your network:\n",
            "By\n",
            "Amanda Hetler,\n",
            "Senior Editor\n",
            "Published: 20 Jun 2024\n",
            "Nvidia continues to grow as it surpassed the $3.335 trillion mark on June 18, 2024, and has now passed Microsoft to become the largest-listed U.S. company based on market value. A few weeks prior, Nvidia passed Apple to become the second most valuable company. In the middle of 2023, Nvidia passed the $1 trillion mark and was more valuable than Amazon and Alphabet, Google's parent company. In just nine months, the company's market worth increased from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in February 2024, and it took only three months to reach $3 trillion in June 2024.\n",
            "The rise of Nvidia took some time. The tech sector faced a rough 2022. It started to rebound in 2023 despite tech layoffs. Generative AI is one of the main drivers of its rebound, and the stock market is showing signs of this rebound. The Nasdaq index is heavy in tech stocks and finished 2023 up 43%. The rise of generative AI led to a tech bull market, which is a time of expansion in the stock exchange.\n",
            "The top-tier group of tech stocks is known as the Magnificent Seven and includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. The Magnificent Seven company stocks were up an average of 111% in 2023, and Nvidia was up 239% in 2023.\n",
            "On June 7, 2024, Nvidia stock completed a 10-for-1 stock split, which will make its stock price approximately $120 from $1,200. The shares will begin trading at the split-adjusted rates on June 10, 2024. Nvidia is splitting its stock to make it more accessible to employees and investors. This split will not change the overall value of the company. This means any stockholder who owned a share of stock before the split will receive nine more shares after the split. Over time, this lower stock price makes it easier for investors to access shares.\n",
            "Even with the daily ups and downs of the stock market, investors are taking notice of this growth and wondering how much the AI demand may drive the tech market in 2024.\n",
            "The rise of Nvidia\n",
            "Nvidia is one of the world's largest producers of GPUs. GPUs are computer chips or semiconductors that use math operations to produce visuals and images. The GPU manages and speeds up graphic workloads and displays visual content on a device such as PC or smartphone.\n",
            "Each of Nvidia's earnings reports exceeded expectations throughout 2023 as AI started gaining momentum and attention. Nvidia's advanced chips can use and process the massive amounts needed to train generative AI programs, such as ChatGPT and Gemini. Since Nvidia dominated this market before the increasing need for AI, Nvidia only grew larger as demand soared.\n",
            "Nvidia reported revenue of $26.0 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter ending April 28, 2024. This revenue was up 18% from the third quarter and up 262% from one year prior. The company earned record quarterly data center revenue of $22.6 billion, which increased 23% from the fourth quarter and was up a noticeable 427% from the previous year.\n",
            "To put it in perspective, companies -- such as Apple and Microsoft -- are spending money on AI, and Nvidia is making money on AI as it produces the chips to run the technology.\n",
            "Nvidia reported revenue of $22.1 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter ending Jan. 28, 2024. This revenue was up 22% from the third quarter and up 265% from one year prior. The company earned $60.9 billion for its full-year revenue, which was up 126%.\n",
            "Businesses need hardware to support high amounts of energy with the AI wave, but these advanced chips are also needed for the metaverse, gaming and spatial computing. Nvidia also makes chips for cars as technology continues to advance.\n",
            "The core reasons for the rise of Nvidia stock\n",
            "The rise of generative AI is one of the key factors of Nvidia's rise. However, there are some other reasons Nvidia stock increased significantly.\n",
            "1. The rise of supercomputers\n",
            "Nvidia's chips power supercomputers because of the large amounts of data needed for this advanced technology. Supercomputing technology is used by companies, such as Meta for its AI Research SuperCluster computer, to train complex AI models. Tesla is also starting to build an AI-focused supercomputer for its vehicles.\n",
            "2. Demand for generative AI\n",
            "With no signs of the demand for generative AI slowing down, Nvidia is poised to grow as each new system is adopted. The AI industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42% in the next 10 years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The demand for generative AI products could make the generative AI market worth $1.3 trillion by 2032.\n",
            "Nvidia's A100 GPU chips are used in training the model for ChatGPT. Companies, such as OpenAI, that use large amounts of data for tasks such as training large language models evolve quickly and need more accelerated computing. The demand for GPUs will only grow as these systems train and evolve with more data.\n",
            "3. The changing world of the metaverse and XR\n",
            "Nvidia has played a role in the metaverse and the virtual and augmented reality landscape with its Omniverse platform. Nvidia offers 3D modeling programs to help stream extended reality (XR) content efficiently. As the metaverse evolves, so does the demand for Nvidia chips to run the metaverse. Companies are turning to XR programs to create virtual environments for training.\n",
            "The gaming world is also a large customer of Nvidia's graphics division. Video games need stronger cards to run the high-resolution images, especially as more games move to the cloud and away from the console. Nvidia's gaming GPUs, such as GeForce RTX 4070, help power video games at a higher resolution and quicker speed.\n",
            "4. Strategic placement\n",
            "Nvidia is a large part of the cryptocurrency world. Miners use its cards for mining tokens, which requires a great deal of power. There was an unprecedented demand for Nvidia's cards as cryptocurrency took off.\n",
            "Future of Nvidia\n",
            "While Nvidia's processors run most of the data centers that power generative AI, there are still some possible challenges ahead, including competition from tech giants to make their own AI chips, economic uncertainty and a rise in competition.\n",
            "The generative AI market is expected to continue growing, but more rules and regulations are going to be introduced that could affect Nvidia's AI chips. The U.S. trade restrictions on China's advanced semiconductors are also impacting Nvidia's growth, as Chinese sales were a large part of Nvidia's data center sales.\n",
            "With Nvidia's noticeable growth, other competitors are offering similar chips, such as AMD's Instinct MI200 family of GPU accelerators. Intel also launched a set of fifth-generation Intel Xeon processors for data centers. Companies may not want to rely on one company and will start exploring these other vendors, which could hurt Nvidia's growth.\n",
            "It's hard to predict whether Nvidia will continue its growth at its current pace. Nvidia has built a solid foundation in the AI market, and if the generative AI market grows as predicted, its revenue will continue to grow. But it's unknown how much of the market Nvidia's competitors will take. Nvidia still has a strong share in the face of rising competition as it recently announced its H200 computing platform. Cloud providers such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft have developed AI processors, but they work with Nvidia chips.\n",
            "The market is evolving quickly. Enterprises are looking to adopt generative AI, leading to the creation of new vendors to meet business needs. New areas such as security and compliance will also change the generative AI market in the business world.\n",

            "What Is Nvidia?\n",
            "Nvidia, founded in 1993, is a global technology company primarily known for its Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) innovations. These GPUs, originally designed to enhance computer graphics for video games, have evolved to serve a variety of complex computing tasks.\n",
            "Nvidia’s prowess extends beyond just hardware: the company has made significant strides in software development, particularly with its CUDA platform, which aids in AI and deep learning applications.\n",
            "Over the years, Nvidia’s contributions have expanded to diverse sectors, including artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and supercomputing.\n",
            "As a result, the company has emerged as a pivotal player in the tech industry, driving advancements that shape our digital future. Nvidia is also one of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ group of influential US mega stocks (along with Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla and Meta Platforms).\n",
            "Nvidia's Price History\n",
            "Nvidia has experienced impressive growth over the past decade but it didn’t always command a four-digit stock price. For those who’ve followed the company since the late 1990s when it went public on the Nasdaq, Nvidia’s evolution offers a case study in perseverance, innovation, and market adaptation.\n",
            "From humble beginnings in the late ’90s with a stock price under $1, Nvidia maintained steady, albeit modest, growth for many years. This period of stability, spanning from the early 2000s to around 2015, might have given the impression of a static company. However, during this time, Nvidia was laying the groundwork for its future, driving advancements in graphics processing units (GPUs) and expanding its foothold in the gaming industry.\n",
            "Post 2015, Nvidia’s stock started to increase materially, mirroring the company’s expansion into new markets, such as data centres, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicles. These endeavours, combined with the continued growth of the gaming industry, propelled Nvidia into the spotlight.\n",
            "Over the past decade, Nvidia’s share price has gained momentum, shooting into the triple-digit range in 2020. After a brief downturn in 2022, Nvidia’s price ground upwards throughout 2023 before surging into 2024. The stock was nudging at four figures per share by March, however, by June 7, the stock price had risen again with news that Nvidia had eclipsed Apple in value, rising to $US1,209 a share. After a stock split in late June, it was trading at $US135 a share.\n",
            "Senior investment analyst at Morningstar, Shani Jayamanne, notes: “Nvidia had an incredibly strong 2023, ending with another quarter of outstanding revenue. (We) expect healthy growth for Nvidia’s data centre revenue beyond 2024.” \n",
            "While still on the higher side, the company’s falling P/E ratio coupled with the significant stock price increase is a strong indication of the company’s ability to generate growth and the investor confidence in its future earnings potential. \n",
            "How Will Nvidia Perform in 2024 and 2025?\n",
            "Given its leadership role in the GPU market and the broader tech industry, Nvidia’s performance in 2024 and beyond is a topic of keen interest. As we head into the second half of 2024, several key factors will determine the company’s trajectory, especially its position in the rapidly growing AI market.\n",
            "The significance of artificial intelligence continues to grow, with applications spanning healthcare to autonomous vehicles. With its advanced GPUs, Nvidia is at the forefront of powering these AI-driven technologies. \n",
            " “We believe that Nvidia’s prospects are tied to the prospects of the AI market in the short to medium term,” Jayamanne says.\n",
            "According to Jayamanne, leading cloud computing companies plan to boost their capital expenditures to satisfy the booming demand for artificial intelligence training and inference. This is significant for Nvidia, because “it appears that virtually all this spending will fall into Nvidia’s pockets”.\n",
            "“Nvidia’s Cuda software should contribute to strong customer stickiness for existing AI models and workloads,” she adds.\n",
            "Due to the exponential rise in AI computing demand, Nvidia’s valuation has been boosted from Morningstar’s 2023 assumptions. However, Jayamanne adds that Morningstar assigns a ‘Very High Uncertainty’ rating due to the competitive and ever-evolving landscape in AI.\n",
            "Competition is also fierce, with Jayamanne noting that while Nvidia is the industry leader in GPUs, AMD and Intel are in hot pursuit.\n",
            "“Nvidia’s valuation really hinges on whether, and for how long, the company can stay ahead of the rest of the pack,” she says.\n",
            "What Does the Future Hold for Nvidia?\n",
            "When analysing the future prospects of Nvidia, investors are met with a mix of strong indicators of growth coupled with potential headwinds.\n",
            "The Bull Case\n",
            "Nvidia’s dominance in the market has been built on a foundation of innovation and technological advancements. One of its core strengths lies in its GPU technology. As Jayamanne puts it: “Nvidia’s GPUs offer industry-leading parallel processing—this is when CPUs run two or more processors to complete a task.” In layman’s terms, this means their GPUs are adept at multitasking at a high speed, ensuring faster program responses.\n",
            " It’s hard to stay the industry leader in the tech space—Nvidia being the leading AI chip vendor may not last long \n",
            "This efficiency is highly coveted in PC gaming, where speed and responsiveness can significantly enhance user experience. “This is what PC gamers need to keep gaming,” she adds.\n",
            "Beyond gaming, the versatility of Nvidia’s GPUs is also evident.\n",
            "“The use cases for a stellar GPU keep growing—they are needed for endeavours, such as crypto mining, AI and possible future applications,” Jayamanne says.\n",
            "This suggests that Nvidia’s GPUs, thanks to their high processing power, are well poised to cater to an expanding market that includes budding sectors like cryptocurrency mining and artificial intelligence.\n",
            "Moreover, Nvidia’s software innovations, especially around the CUDA platform, set it apart.\n",
            "“Nvidia’s GPU and CUDA software platform makes them the dominant vendor for AI model training,” Jayamanne says.\n",
            "With AI integration becoming more prevalent, the demand for efficient model training platforms like CUDA is expected to surge.\n",
            "On the autonomous vehicle front, Nvidia is also pioneering change. As Jayamanne notes, the company has a first-mover advantage in the autonomous driving market, which paves the way for adopting its Drive PX self-driving platform.\n",
            "With AI seemingly being integrated into every aspect of our lives, Jayamanne believes Nvidia’s future is bright, saying “Fiscal 2025 looks to be a banner year for Nvidia as demand continues to exceed supply.”\n",
            "The Bear Case\n",
            "But even giants like Nvidia face significant uncertainties. While its accolades and valuations are impressive, the path ahead is not without potential challenges.\n",
            "“It’s hard to stay the industry leader in the tech space—Nvidia being the leading AI chip vendor may not last long,” Jayamanne says.\n",
            "The CUDA platform, though currently a leader in AI training software and tools, is not without its potential pitfalls—namely competition.\n",
            "“In the past, software and tools like this have moved to open-source, which could destroy CUDA’s value,” Jayamanne says.\n",
            "Furthermore, a significant portion of Nvidia’s acclaim is tied to its GPU business, a market heavily influenced by PC demand and, more recently, the volatile world of cryptocurrencies.\n",
            "Jayamanne adds: “Nvidia’s GPU business is reliant on PC demand, and more recently crypto mining.”\n",
            "The implication here is clear: should there be a decline in either of these sectors, it would inevitably lead to reduced demand for Nvidia’s GPUs, potentially impacting their market share and revenues.\n",
            "Is Nvidia a Good Investment?\n",
            "Understanding a company’s competitive advantage, or “moat,” can be pivotal in decision-making. A “moat” typically represents a company’s ability to maintain its market leadership, ward off competitors, and sustain its earnings.\n",
            "“We believe that Nvidia has a wide moat. We award moats to companies that have sustainable competitive advantages,” says Jayamanne.\n",
            "“Companies that have a wide moat can protect and grow their earnings over at least the next 20 years, and keep competitors at bay.”\n",
            "Nvidia’s competitive advantage is rooted in two primary sources according to Jayamanne. The first originates from “intangible assets.” This essentially means Nvidia’s distinct capabilities that aren’t easily replicated or replaced. Their dominance in the GPU market, with over 80% share, per Mercury Research, is a testament to this. The key to their supremacy isn’t just about the hardware but also the intricate “software, frameworks, and tools required by developers to work with these GPUs”.\n",
            "The second pillar of Nvidia’s moat revolves around the concept of “switching costs”. High switching costs signify customer loyalty and barriers to moving away from a particular product or service.\n",
            "“The switching costs are with its CUDA platform for AI tools—it enables developers to use Nvidia’s GPUs to build AI models,” Jayamanne says.\n",
            "This means that developers ingrained in the Nvidia ecosystem may find it challenging and costly to transition elsewhere, reinforcing Nvidia’s market position.\n",
            "However, a company’s competitive advantages don’t operate in isolation. Its financial health and strategic investments are crucial in sustaining its dominance.\n",
            "“They have a sound balance sheet, exceptional investments associated with the firm’s strategy and execution, and appropriate shareholder distribution policies,” Jayamanne notes.\n",
            "Yet, with every investment, risks and uncertainties are inherent. One significant factor to consider is the unpredictable nature of the AI market.\n",
            "Furthermore, there’s looming competition which could challenge Nvidia’s position.\n",
            "“We think it is inevitable that leading hyperscale vendors, such as Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms will seek to reduce their reliance on Nvidia and diversify their semiconductor and software supplier base, including the development of in-house solutions,” Jayamanne says.\n",
            "While both Nvidia’s bull and bear cases are telling, it’s essential to factor in individual investment strategies and preferences. For instance, Jayamanne notes that if an investor primarily seeks a consistent dividend income then “Nvidia’s payout ratio has been volatile, to say the least”. This may not appeal to those looking for stable returns.\n",
            "“Ultimately, a good investment is acquiring a quality company at a great price, but also considering your financial goals,” she says.\n",
            "Lastly, for Australian investors, there’s an additional layer to consider—currency fluctuations. The value of the US dollar against the AUD can significantly influence returns.\n",
            "While Nvidia showcases substantial competitive advantages and growth potential, investors must weigh these strengths against individual goals, risk tolerance, and external market conditions before deciding to invest.\n",

            "How much will Nvidia be worth in five years?\n",
            "Over the next five years, Nvidia’s worth will be influenced by its sustained competitive advantages, like its wide moat stemming from intangible assets and the increasing switching costs associated with its Cuda platform. However, with the tech landscape rapidly evolving and potential challenges from other tech giants, Nvidia’s valuation will be a function of its adaptability and continued innovation.\n",
            "Is Nvidia stock a buy or hold?\n",
            "Buying or holding Nvidia stock is deeply personal, hinging on individual investment goals and market perceptions. Nvidia’s strong foothold in GPU technology, AI model training, and autonomous driving does position it favourably in the eyes of many investors. However, factors like the company’s volatile dividend payout ratio and the broader uncertainties of the AI market can influence investment decisions. As always, investors must undertake comprehensive research and seek expert financial advice if necessary.\n",
            "How high is Nvidia stock expected to go?\n",
            "Nvidia has had a blistering run the past six months, breaching $US1,000 a share, before a 10-for-1 stock split in June. It has leap-frogged over Apple and Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable company. Investors are watching the company carefully given its influential position in the tech industry, particularly in areas like gaming, data centres, autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence. While predicting the exact future price of Nvidia’s stock is challenging due the ever-evolving landscape of the competitive landscape, many experts are bullish on Nvidia in the near-term given the exponential rise in demand for AI.
